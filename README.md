### Big data is made of people.

This repo explores how that works - how all the individual data points make up the constellation of our lives.

=== 

To add your own points, simply open "postcards.json" and add your points at the top.  You can add them by hand with a chunk of geoJSON that'll look like this:

    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {},
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          -81.650390625,
          39.8928799002948
        ]
      }
    },

Or you can use tools like [geoJson](http://geojson.io/).
